    I'm a passionate Senior Software Engineer who pairs deep technical expertise with a wide strategic lens. My background in computational linguistics lets me weave human-language technologies, machine learning, and AI into products that engage users and unlock new value. I am an active proponent of Open Source, contributing significantly to the Drupal community and pioneering HTMX integrations for efficient, modern web interfaces.
    
    Whether I'm building large-scale NLP pipelines or refining user flows, I keep one eye on the technical detail and the other on the bigger business goal. I thrive on continuous improvement: digging into complex topics, sharing what I learn, and iterating quickly through agile practices and automation. Currently, I am exploring multi-agent systems to discover how autonomous agents can cooperate to solve complex problems.

      summary: |
        At DFKI GmbH (German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence) in Berlin, worked as a Student Researcher
        on an innovative multilingual mobile dialogue assistant. Contributed to natural language understanding and
        dialogue design by applying core concepts from computational linguistics, such as syntax, semantics,
        and speech technologies. Developed an SVM-based algorithm for question–answer pair detection and
        improved dialogue coherence for a diploma thesis project.
        Received positive feedback in [performance review](/data/dfki.pdf).
      highlights:
        - Developed a multilingual mobile dialogue assistant (PHP, Objective‑C).
        - Designed and trained an SVM-based classification algorithm for automatic detection of question–answer pairs.
        - Improved dialogue structure and naturalness based on semantic parsing and user behavior.
        - Integrated text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) components into mobile dialogue interactions.
        - Focused on agent-based dialogue modeling and interaction flows for natural user experiences.
